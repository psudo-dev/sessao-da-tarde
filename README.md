## About <a name = "about"></a>

It popped up in a conversation and I looked for a Sess達o da Tarde generator but I could only find one - I thought there were more, early 2000s were full of generators.

But you had to choose all the options so I thought it would work better if I could simply randomize the choices. I made a few adjustments here and there in the text, added a few things and that's how it started. I'm making this repository because I intend to expand on that later.
